# How-To-Be-An-Admin
this is to help people with poor experience to moderate games (Roblox and Others) and more as a admin who abuse and has to take a custom test or something or a trial learning how to be an admin to help your game 

reasons why i made this
i have found out some people ask how to do things and more well these files like ROBLOX ADMIN or DISCORD ADMIN is the best way to know what to do and how to do it but i know rules are diffent in every game or server so im telling the basic of what i will do and you can have these rules or know what to do or just take your trials/abusers in here to teach them.
